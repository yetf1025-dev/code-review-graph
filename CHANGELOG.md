# Changelog

## [1.6.2] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Incremental hash comparison bug — `file_hash` read from wrong field, causing every file to re-parse
- Watch mode `on_deleted` handler now filters by ignore patterns
- Removed dead code in `full_build` and duplicate `main()` in `incremental.py`
- `get_staged_and_unstaged` handles git renamed files (`R old -> new`)
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md hook config path corrected

### Added
- **Parser: C/C++ support** — full node extraction (structs, classes, functions, includes, calls, inheritance)
- **Parser: name extraction** fixes for Kotlin/Swift (`simple_identifier`), Ruby (`constant`), C/C++ nested `function_declarator`
- `GraphStore` context manager (`__enter__`/`__exit__`)
- `get_all_edges()` and `get_edges_among()` public methods on `GraphStore`
- NetworkX graph caching with automatic invalidation on writes
- Subprocess timeout (30s) on all git calls
- Progress logging every 50 files in full build
- SHA-256 hashing in embeddings (replaced MD5)
- Chunked embedding search (`fetchmany(500)`)
- Batch edge collection in `get_impact_radius` (single SQL query)
- ARIA labels throughout D3.js visualization
- **CI**: Coverage enforcement (`--cov-fail-under=50`), bandit security scanning, mypy type checking
- **Tests**: `test_incremental.py` (24 tests), `test_embeddings.py` (16 tests)
- **Test fixtures**: C, C++, C#, Ruby, PHP, Kotlin, Swift with multilang test classes
- **Docs**: API response schemas in COMMANDS.md, ignore patterns in USAGE.md

## [1.5.3] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- `init` now auto-creates symlinks when paths contain spaces (macOS iCloud, OneDrive, etc.)
- `build`, `status`, `visualize`, `watch` work without a git repository (falls back to cwd)
- Skills discoverable via plugin.json (`name` field added to SKILL.md frontmatter)

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **File organization**: All generated files now live in `.code-review-graph/` directory instead of repo root
  - Auto-created `.gitignore` inside the directory prevents accidental commits
  - Automatic migration from legacy `.code-review-graph.db` at repo root
- **Visualization: start collapsed**: Only File nodes visible on load; click to expand children
- **Visualization: search bar**: Filter nodes by name or qualified name in real-time
- **Visualization: edge type toggles**: Click legend items to show/hide edge types (Calls, Imports, Inherits, Contains)
- **Visualization: scale-aware layout**: Force simulation adapts charge, distance, and decay for large graphs (300+ nodes)

### Changed
- Database path: `.code-review-graph.db` → `.code-review-graph/graph.db`
- HTML visualization path: `.code-review-graph.html` → `.code-review-graph/graph.html`
- `.code-review-graph/**` added to default ignore patterns (prevents self-indexing)

### Removed
- `references/` directory (duplicate of `docs/`, caused stale path references)
- `agents/` directory (unused, not wired into any code)
- `settings.json` at repo root (decorative, not loaded by code)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- `init` command: automatic `.mcp.json` setup for Claude Code integration
- `visualize` command: interactive D3.js force-directed graph visualization
- `serve` command: start MCP server directly from CLI

### Changed
- Comprehensive documentation overhaul across all reference files

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- Universal installation: now works with `pip install code-review-graph[embeddings]` on Python 3.10+
- CLI entry point (`code-review-graph` command works after normal pip install)
- Clear Python version check with helpful Docker fallback for older Python users
- Improved README installation section with one-command + Docker option

### Changed
- Minimum Python requirement lowered from 3.11 → 3.10 (covers ~90% of users)

### Fixed
- Installation friction for most developers
